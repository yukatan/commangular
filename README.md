* Website  : [http://commangular.tk](http://commangular.org)

## Overview

Commangular is a concept on top of angularJS that aims at simplifying the creation and organization of operations in a self-contained code units and chain them together with an easy and fluent API.That code units are called 'commands'

Commands can be easily tested, reused, and developed in isolation.

It is inspired by [Parsley 3 Framework](https://github.com/spicefactory) and [Jens Halm](https://github.com/jenshalm) command concept. 


### Main features :

* Chaining commands in command groups.
* Command execution in sequence or parallel.
* Nesting commands at any level.
* Dependency injection from angular.
* Preceding result injection.
* Cancelation and pause based on promises
* Command flows with decision points. 
* Command aspects (Interception of command execution).
* Custom result resolvers(on the way).


## Installation

* Using bower : ``` bower install commangular ```
* Download it and add commangular.js or commangular.min.js to your index.html.

Remember to add commangular.js after angular.js. Commangular only depends on angularJs, it is not using other libraries.
